Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm a **Mobile Dev Freelancer** with deep experience with Android & iOS. I'm passionate about creating beautiful mobile experiences that reach a global audience.

When I'm not coding, you can find me climbing, cycling, or doing something active.

Currently traveling the world with my wife. Follow our adventures at [Hopeless Nomadics](https://www.hopelessnomadics.com).
