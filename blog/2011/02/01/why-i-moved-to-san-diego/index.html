      As I mentioned in my previous post, I recently moved to San Diego from New Jersey a couple weeks ago to start my new job as a Software Designer for HP. The job is great, I&#8217;m getting paid decently, and San Diego is simply amazing! The weather is perfect—I can run in the morning at any of the 6 beaches 10-15 minutes away from me, I can climb rocks indoors and outdoors any day of the year, and I can even surf and snowboard&#8230; all in the same frikin&#8217; day! It&#8217;s beautiful and surreal. It almost seems too good to be true and to be honest with you, it&#8217;s very comfortable and it&#8217;s also easy to stay that way. 

The topic of comfort came about from this <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/confessions-techie/201101/comfort-kills">article</a> I read from Psychology Today entitled &#8220;Comfort Kills&#8221;. As the title suggests, the author argues that comfort is a block to &#8220;living life&#8221;. It is a hindrance to growth, and I can&#8217;t agree more.

Technically, I moved because I got a job. Did I intend on moving to San Diego specifically? Not really, it just happened that way. Back when I was in grad school, I was looking for an opportunity that would put me in the forefront of emerging technologies. I applied to Google (got thru 2 rounds with them), Adobe, Yelp, facebook, Microsoft, Apple, HP, you name it, I most likely applied there. These job locations were also all over the place—Pittsburgh PA, Seattle WA, Madison WI, London UK, upstate NY, Texas, San Francisco CA, San Diego CA, etc. As long as the opportunity presented to me is consistent with my personal and professional goals, I would move anywhere. As I was telling a friend, I didn&#8217;t care if I had to live on the moon for 2-3 years nor if I had to live under a rock for a couple years, as long as it was a necessary step for me to progress in life, I&#8217;ll do it! The reason why I was also so open to the idea of moving somewhere far is because I&#8217;ve never done that. I&#8217;ve never moved away from the nest wherein if I get stuck in a situation I can&#8217;t just simply ask my parents for help, I have to figure that sh*t out by myself. To me, the thought of moving away is very exciting but at the same time, the thought of being on my own scared me sh*tless. I would have to make new friends, settle in, find a hobby, etc. What if I hated it? What if I wanted to quit but couldn&#8217;t because of bills? What if I become miserable? There were so many questions in my head; however, I know if I had stayed, I would have regretted not moving for the rest of my life. That idea of regret is something I know that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to live with; hence, I planned, took action, and decided that I would move.

I&#8217;m not here in San Diego to settle in, get comfortable, and experience a &#8220;better life&#8221;. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, all of those things I mentioned about California are beautiful and I feel extremely lucky to be where I&#8217;m at. However, the real reason why I&#8217;m here is because of the opportunity for growth—for the chance of &#8220;leveling up&#8221; to Chris Arriola 2.0 (I know, dorky). I see this move as a step forward to personal success and a step away from the &#8220;what if?&#8221; thinking. I want to end each day knowing that not only did I do my best, but I also lived that day with integrity and without compromise by fear.
