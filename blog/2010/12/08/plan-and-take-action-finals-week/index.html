      I have a final later today at 10:30 a.m., and I didn&#8217;t study yet. Am I going to pull off an all-nighter? Probably not, it&#8217;s not worth it.

Anyway, I decided to blog instead of studying because I&#8217;m pretty overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to do before I move to San Diego this January: (1) finish finals and school projects, (2) sell all my furniture by the end of December and move out of philly, (3) work on my side-projects and volunteer work, (4) <del>find an apartment in San Diego</del>, (5) spend time with friends and family, (6) and finally, plan my road trip to the west coast.

Yup, I&#8217;m going on a frikin&#8217; road trip! I can&#8217;t wait to go sight-seeing in Washington D.C., check out a vineyard in Virginia, grab some ribs and pull-pork sandwiches in Tennessee,  try some Creole and Cajun cooking in Louisiana, check out Texas (not really sure what to do there yet&#8230; haha), meet some aliens in Roswell, New Mexico, camp out by the grand canyon in Arizona, gamble in Vegas, and finally surf my way down to San Diego &#8211; my soon to be hometown.

What excites me the most about this trip is not really the trip itself, (although it is very exciting!) but instead, it&#8217;s the fact that it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always wanted to do, and I&#8217;m actually about to do it. Another crossed-out item in my EXTREMELY long &#8220;list&#8221; of things-to-do before I die, before I <em>kick the bucket</em> if you will. I&#8217;m certain that each one of us has this &#8220;list&#8221; of things-to-do, maybe not necessarily written down but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s in the back of our heads. So my question is to you&#8230; are you actively trying to cross each item out on that list? Or are you instead passively waiting &#8211; maybe for some external force to come help you out with that list (aliens maybe?). In my opinion, the latter is a VERY sad and scary way to live life, no offense. Not having the time is never an excuse. If it&#8217;s something you want to do badly, make time! Maybe it&#8217;s also about time to &#8220;refactor<em>&#8221;</em> your priorities and adjust accordingly. It&#8217;s also understandable that money can be an issue (esp. for recent college grads with a shit load of loans!), but with the proper goals set in mind, it&#8217;s usually not. A typical road-trip around the U.S. could take about $1000-$1200. I know that seems a lot, but if you save instead of spending on useless junk not consistent with your goals &#8211; such as splurging every weekend at bars and clubs (I have nothing against that, just an example) &#8211; then eventually you&#8217;ll have that amount of money.

Our brains are such interesting objects, and if you think about it from an evolutionary stand-point, we make excuses because<em> it is the most immediate and comforting thing to do &#8211; </em>it actually makes sense! Unfortunately. We blame not doing something to something or someone else to convince ourselves that it was out of our &#8220;locust of control.&#8221; In a way, diffussing the responsibility. It&#8217;s so much easier to stay home and sleep all day as opposed to running 10 miles each morning to train for a marathon. I could come up with so many examples with this topic because I personally made those excuses not only to others, but also to myself. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it because of A, B, C, D, &#8230;, Z&#8221; and a bunch of other alphabets that don&#8217;t even exist.

So what&#8217;s my point in writing all of this (aside from me trying to convince my brain that I&#8217;m doing something productive to avoid studying for my final)? Well, I just hope that if you&#8217;re reading this and it&#8217;s something you can relate to, my words of advice are very simple. <em>If you want to achieve/do/try something, plan and take action.</em> Internalize that statement. Your mother probably told you that when you were a kid but you didn&#8217;t hear it because you were too busy playing games. My mom did&#8230; and yes, I didn&#8217;t hear it because I was too busy playing games &#8211; I don&#8217;t regret it, final fantasy is frikin awesome! But anyway, today might just be your lucky day because I&#8217;m reminding you of that statement. Plan and take action.
