2 days ago I posted my take on how to achieve success in the "real world." I spoke a little bit about my experiences going into college and how my perception of success changed over the years. It can be found at the JOCC blog (<a href="http://thelifeofajocc.blogspot.com/2011/05/achieving-success-in-real-worldits-not.html">http://thelifeofajocc.blogspot.com/2011/05/achieving-success-in-real-worldits-not.html</a>/).
