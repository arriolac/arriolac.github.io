If I can summarize my time in San Diego in 2 words it would be: "<em>Fuckin' Awesome."</em> Seriously, I cannot ask for more. My job is amazing, social life is picking up, been rock climbing a lot and really active, and I've been pretty consistent. Lately, however, I've been complacent and comfortable with where I'm at. I mean, who wouldn't be?? San Diego is the shit! At the moment, I'm reading Brian Tracy's <em>Goals!</em> and it just made me realize that I need to reassess and reevaluate where I'm at and where I want to be. It's that point again where I'm getting comfortable with my situation. I know I can't stay being comfortable if I want to achieve anything in life. At least achieving something "great" as I would define it. The two aspects that would give direction and sense in myself would be: <strong>values</strong> and <strong>goals</strong>. So let's figure these out...

<strong>Values</strong>

I understand that values are ever changing. As I experience new things and learn more about the world, my values shift as well. Now I don't mean to say that I'm like a leaf going wherever the wind blows, but instead, I'm attempting to be adaptable and versatile in life. Change, as Dr. John Ayudtud used to say, is inevitable. Going against change is not the solution, however, accepting change and adapting accordingly is. That said, here are my "new" (not that different from when I last brainstormed about this) values:
<ol>
	<li>Passion for work - I do my best with anything thrown at me or anything that I set my mind to accomplish. I know I included the word "work" in here, but anything applies. I'm a frikkin' man of my word and I get the job done. Exceptionally.</li>
	<li>Adventurous - this is a value that have gone up the ranks from when I last wrote about my values. I want to experience and live life to the fullest, and for me, that entails being adventurous. Travelling, trying new things, being daring, and pushing myself to the limit, are all part of this value.</li>
	<li>Responsible/Trustworthy - This closely ties to the first value. Again, I am a man of my word, and I get the job done. I only commit to things that I can actually finish. My word is impeccable.</li>
	<li>Virtuous/Person of Integrity - I don't compromise my values no matter what. This, I feel, is where I need the most work. But hey, no one said it was going to be easy right!</li>
</ol>
<strong>Goals</strong>

Based on these values, I decided to reevaluate my goals and I asked myself, "What is it that if I accomplish would change my life for the better?" And I came up with several things but for the year 2011 (since I did say values and goals for 2011) it would be:
<ol>
	<li>Climb a mountain (multi-pitch) - I want to do some multi-pitch climbing and climb a frikkin mountain. I would love to climb El Capitan in Yosemite but to be honest, I don't have to climb El Capitan this year (although I would like to do that down the line). As long as I get my feet wet with multi-pitch climbing and reaching the summit, that would be considerable progress for me already.</li>
	<li>Get better at writing - I've always hated writing because I was never good at it. Then I realized, if I want to be heard, I need to learn how to write effectively. With power. Readers of the JOCC blog would not be interested if my writing sucks. I definitely need to get better at this.</li>
	<li>Communicating effectively - this also ties into my writing skills. If I were to be heard and my ideas noticed/respected, I need to be an excellent communicator. At my job, I know that my thoughts aren't being understood as easily because of the way I explain my ideas. Working on this is essential.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:24px;">I have a ton of other values/goals that I could've written in this post but the ones that would change it all are written above. Let's see how this goes!!</span></span>
