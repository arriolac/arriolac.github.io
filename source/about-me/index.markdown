Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm a **Software Engineer** who specializes in developing mobile apps for both Android and iOS. I've created apps ranging from real-time messaging, to an education social network app for K12. I also love to teach and have recently published a [book on RxJava](../book) and taught a [course on ARKit](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-arkit--nd114) 

When I'm not coding, you can find me [traveling](https://www.hopelessnomadics.com), climbing, or cycling somewhere.
