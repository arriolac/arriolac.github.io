  <div class="entry-content">One of the many pleasures in life involves learning something new. Whether it be learning a new culture, learning how to paint, learning how to write creatively, or learning how to fly a kite; the act of &#8220;knowing&#8221; something is nothing less than exciting. With that said, I&#8217;m a firm believer in the active pursuit of self-learning and self-education—who said learning should stop in school? Perhaps graduating school is the end of formal learning, but if it were the end of learning in itself, life would be very, very, boring.

Below are some resources I&#8217;ve used in the past for taking free online classes. As my Calc 2 professor would say, these resources are &#8220;jewels in a priceless treasure chest&#8221;.

<strong>Coursera: </strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">https://www.coursera.org/</a>

<strong>Academic Earth: </strong><a href="http://www.academicearth.org/">http://www.academicearth.org/</a>

<strong>Khan Academy: </strong><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">http://www.khanacademy.org/</a>

<strong></strong><strong>MIT Open Courseware: </strong><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">http://ocw.mit.edu/</a>

<strong></strong><strong>Engineer Guy: </strong><a href="http://www.engineerguy.com/">http://www.engineerguy.com/</a>

<strong>Google Code University: </strong><a href="http://code.google.com/edu/">http://code.google.com/edu/</a>

<strong></strong>&#8230;and of course it goes without saying that another great resource for self-learning is&#8230; a book! I&#8217;m currently using <a href="www.goodreads.com">www.goodreads.com</a> to find good recommendations based on books I&#8217;ve read on the past, and it&#8217;s also a good social website to view what your friends are currently reading and what they&#8217;ve read in the past.

I hope you find these priceless &#8220;jewels&#8221; as invaluable as I found them. Enjoy!

  <div class="entry-content">An <a href="http://chrisarriola.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/first-android-application-napp/">exercise</a> I did to practice threading on Android is to implement a simple countdown timer. To do this, I used a <em>Handler</em> and added a <em>Runnable</em> Object—which performs the countdown—to it&#8217;s message queue.

Here&#8217;s a snippet of the Runnable Object:
<pre>Runnable mTimerTask = new Runnable() {
@Override
public void run() {
  long currTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
  long currTimeSysClock = SystemClock.uptimeMillis();
  long timeLeftMillis = mWakeUpTime - currTime;
  int seconds = (int) timeLeftMillis / 1000;
  int minutes = seconds / 60;
  int hours = minutes / 60;
  seconds %= 60;
  minutes %= 60;
  updateTime(mSecondView, seconds);
  updateTime(mMinuteView, minutes);
  updateTime(mHourView, hours);

  if (hours == 0 &amp;&amp; minutes == 0 &amp;&amp; seconds == 0) {
    mTimerHandler.removeCallbacks(this);
  } else {
    mTimerHandler.postAtTime(this, currTimeSysClock + 1000);
  }
  }
};</pre>
Finally, passing the Runnable object to the Handler&#8217;s <em>post()</em> method will initiate the countdown sequence.

Essentially, the run method gets called every 1 second following the first call to run ( <em>postAtTime()</em> ). The process is then repeated until the countdown reaches 0. To prevent reseting the wake up time, the wake up time (<em>mWakeUpTime</em>) is saved in the app&#8217;s shared preferences.

Another approach that could&#8217;ve also been used is through the use of an <em>AsyncTask</em>. However, for a simple task such as a countdown timer and since we want to control the specific time a thread runs, a Handler would be the best way to go.

  <div class="entry-content">At last, the most anticipated app for Android came out a few days ago: Instagram for Android. For the first 12 hours, they hit an amazing 1 million Android app downloads! Now they&#8217;re at the ~6 million mark and they just got bought out by Facebook for $1 billion. I thought to myself: &#8220;great, now everyone is happy.&#8221;

I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong.

An alarming number of iPhone users and apple fans were ranting about how lame Instagram is now that it&#8217;s open to Android users. Here&#8217;s a few example of what people were saying:
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://chrisarriola.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/hatetweets.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-305 aligncenter" title="hatetweets" src="http://chrisarriola.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/hatetweets.png" alt="" width="510" height="492" /></a></p>
For the majority of the smartphone population, Android has always been perceived as being &#8220;low quality&#8221; compared to the iPhone. Social status has a big influence to Android being perceived this way. All the wealthy folks can brag about how awesome their iPhone is whereas people on the low-end have to compromise with shitty Android phones since they&#8217;re too poor to buy iPhones, right? If you look at a lot of high-end Android phones though, this is obviously not the case. iPhone users, however, still feel that they&#8217;re getting the best bang for their buck because of the exceptional brand-value Apple established for itself thanks to Steve Jobs. Looking beyond the surface though, there are many pros about Android which makes me believe otherwise.

Here&#8217;s why I think Android is pure awesomeness.

<strong>Options</strong>

I enjoy having many options. This goes for food, clothes, places, as well as phones. One of the features I particularly enjoy that some Android phones have is a physical keyboard—which is something iPhone lacks. Not going to lie though, iPhone&#8217;s hardware is beautiful but the idea of having only a single option doesn&#8217;t really float my boat.

<strong>Inexpensive</strong>

When I first used a smartphone I was frikin&#8217; hooked. I could simply Google questions like: &#8220;what&#8217;s the weather tomorrow?&#8221;, &#8220;how does the internet work?&#8221;, &#8220;when and where will be the next meteor shower?&#8221;, etc. Better yet, I can find location and context-specific answers to questions such as &#8220;where&#8217;s the closest restaurant/bar?&#8221;, &#8220;where can I get orange juice?&#8221;, etc. With smartphones, answers to such questions are virtually at your fingertips, anywhere you go. In the past, this was only available to the privileged, however, nowadays (thanks to Android) <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2011/08/16/80-android-phone-sells-like-hotcakes-in-kenya-the-world-next/">anyone can get a smartphone for as cheap as $80</a>! Why should only the rich have access to things like this when the less-fortunate would benefit from it the most?

<strong>Open-Source</strong>

Anyone can go in and look at Android&#8217;s source code and create a custom OS. Because Android is Open Source, we can expect many different flavors that suit different needs—android running on <a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/product/printer/Photosmart/1/storefronts/CQ140A%2523B1H">printers</a>, android running on <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/nook/379003208/">e-readers</a>, etc. These are only a few examples and expect Android to dominate the OS of choice for other embedded systems.

<strong>Cross-Application Integration</strong>

One word: Intents.

Android Intents essentially enable applications to &#8220;talk&#8221; to each other. What that means to the end-user is that you have many different options (depending on the apps installed on your device) when let&#8217;s say for instance you want to share a location, article, photo, etc. Whereas on other platforms such as the iPhone, you&#8217;re limited to only what the OS provides which is typically the native apps such as messaging/e-mail. This of course is not only limited to sharing content. Another example would be if you have a camera/photo application and want to launch that app for another app that takes pictures. Assuming that app exposes it&#8217;s functionality (side note: why doesn&#8217;t Instagram do this?), on Android you would be able to do that without going through intermediate steps, i.e. capturing a photo with app 1, saving image, opening app 2&#8230; I think you get the point.

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://chrisarriola.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/torreypines2_sandiego.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Torrey Pines" src="http://chrisarriola.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/torreypines2_sandiego.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
It&#8217;s officially my last week of living here in San Diego. It&#8217;s been a tremendous experience and it&#8217;s hard to believe I&#8217;m leaving this piece of paradise (I&#8217;m going to miss you yearlong mid-70 degree weather)!

I&#8217;ve always been a huge advocate of goal-setting and having the end in mind. To me, if one is compelled by a vision, then one must make the steps to fulfill that vision. This entails making all the necessary changes to get to the end point. Every action, I view, should be a result of striving for a larger goal. No matter the difficulty of the action, if it is necessary, it must be made. Failure to do so, makes all the difference between getting what you want, and what you don&#8217;t want.

With that said, zooming out 10,000 feet and putting into perspective the bigger picture, for me to achieve my long-term goals, I need to make the necessary steps in the present to get to where I want to be. At the moment, that means leaving the confines of HP and joining an exciting startup in the bay area. Startups and social innovation have always fascinated me and it only makes sense for me to move towards that direction. Personally, I find it easy to get sucked into something simply because it&#8217;s interesting or comforting. However, I know that for me to feel a sense of fulfillment, I need look beyond the mist and act in accordance to my goals and follow my passion. Even if that means leaving something as beautiful as San Diego.

Farewell, San Diego. You will be severely missed!

Really fun to read and I found his writing style to be hilarious! If you read personal development books, there is no new principle/information you will learn here. If you internalize the concepts he writes about, however, it&#8217;s extremely liberating.

I find that the analogy between performing on a stage and social interaction to be very accurate. Despite, however, all the contextual masks we wear in everyday life; actions, scripts, and facades put up by the wearer are still guided by one underlying principle: core values. Although not as emphasized in the book, Erving Goffman does a great job pointing this out.
