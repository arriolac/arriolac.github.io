I've been reading this book by Tim Ferris, <em>"The 4-Hour Work Week", </em>and he talks about having a 3 or 6 month "dreamline" to keep him in check of what he wants out of life. A dreamline is pretty much like goal-setting but it differs in several aspects:

<em>1. The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps.
2. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective.
</em><em>3. It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Living</span> like aÂ millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.</em>

It's actually been a while since I last jotted down my short-term/long-term goals and this dreamline concept sounds like a great opportunity to do so. Besides, it's not really goal-setting, it's more of "life-setting". What follows are the questions he asks that should be answered in a person's dreamline -- I'm going to go through them one-by-one.

<strong>1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world?</strong>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;"><em>6 month:
</em></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Having: </em>A macbook, Das ultimate keyboard, and a professional wardrobe (I need to be more specific with this).
</span><em><span style="color:#000000;">Being: </span></em><span style="color:#000000;">An amazing mobile/web programmer, a great athlete (climbing, running, working-out), a great worker, friend and family guy.
</span><em>Doing: </em>Running a half-marathon, surfing, going to tech conferences and networking with amazing programmers, working on a "muse" -- that is, a self-sustained cash machine, every weekend have a 24 hour whatever-athon, eating out every weekend!

<span style="color:#000000;"><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">12 month:</span>
<span style="color:#000000;"><em>Having: </em></span></em><span style="color:#000000;">A Mazda 3 Hatchback, a new phone, a TV, again... an amazing wardrobe</span><em><span style="color:#000000;"><em>
Being: </em></span></em><span style="color:#000000;">An amazing mobile/web programmer, a great athlete (climbing, running, working-out, surfer), a great worker, friend and family guy.</span><em><span style="color:#000000;"><em>
</em></span><em>Doing:</em></em> Running a full-marathon, going to tech conferences and networking with amazing programmers, traveling to a new country, climb a mountain.</span>

<strong>2. Drawing a blank?</strong>

<strong>a. What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank?</strong>

I would make sure to dine out whenever I want (at least once a day), I would dress up like I do own $100 million in the bank, and I would make sure that I do something active everyday whether it be climbing, running, surfing, working-out, etc. (It's funny, each day actually doesn't require that much money for me -- except for the food and the clothes)

<strong>b. What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day?</strong>

Waking up to the sound of the waves from the beach outside my window in my room or living room. Also, knowing that I'm going to be doing something exciting, whatever it may be, that day would wake me up.

<strong>3. What does "being" entail doing?</strong>

An amazing mobile/web developer -&gt; <strong>everyday</strong> working on learning more about mobile/web, working on an application, mastering a programming language, networking with amazing programmers, brushing up on my coding habits, and reading programming books <strong>everyday</strong>.

A great athlete -&gt; <strong>everyday </strong>doing something active, deliberately practicing on a given task.

A great worker/friend/family -&gt; taking initiative, being on time, not breaking promises, showing the effort I put in.

<strong>4. What are the four dreams that would change it all?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Running a half and full marathon</li>
	<li>Climb a mountain</li>
	<li>Starting my own muse</li>
	<li>Being an amazing mobile/web programmer</li>
</ul>
