My friends and I are collaborating on this <a href="http://www.thelifeofajocc.com/">blog</a> called <em>The Life of a JOCC</em>. Our original intention behind the blog is for us to have a place where we can share our experiences and lessons learned in life. It would be a blog wherein people can relate and share their experiences as well. Through time, we refined this idea and came up with the concept of a JOCC.Â A JOCC basically embodies the core values that my friends and I believe in. We strive to be JOCCs and working on this together is our very own way of expressing the JOCCs within ourselves. On our recent post, we address exactly <em>"What is a JOCC?" </em>Check it out right <a href="http://www.thelifeofajocc.com/">here</a>!!
