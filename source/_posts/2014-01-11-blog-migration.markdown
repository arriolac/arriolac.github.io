Just moved my blog from a <a href="www.chrisarriola.wordpress.com">wordpress.com site</a> to Octopress hosted on GitHub. Surprisingly, the set-up was really quick including migrating all of my posts and tweaking some colors from the theme I chose. Not everything went smoothly though; I lost all of my comments and images on posts had some formatting issues. Aside from that, it only took a few hours.

Feel free to leave a comment for any suggestions!
