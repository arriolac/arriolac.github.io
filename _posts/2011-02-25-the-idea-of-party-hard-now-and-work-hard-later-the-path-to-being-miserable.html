I constantly encounter people that tell me that I'm way too old for my age. They tell me that I shouldn't be working hard and spending too much time on building my career and that I should instead be doing what young people do, going out and partying. Although I don't have anything against going out and partying in itself (trust me, I go ALL OUT when I party), I am however bothered by the underlying idea that people at a young age should be going crazy and later in life should they be more responsible. Not only does this by default give young people the entitlement of being reckless, I also believe that this model of living would lead to being miserable.

I know, that is a very strong statement to make
