Check out a course I developed at Udacity on [ARKit using Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-arkit--nd114) (SceneKit)!

Developing course material, and teaching it, has really pushed me to grow (both technical and non-technical) and I'm excited to share it with the world.

Let's make some _AWESOME_ AR apps ðŸ˜€
