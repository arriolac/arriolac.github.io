<blockquote>"<strong>Life is a series of near misses. But a lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It's seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It's seeing what other people don't see, and pursuing that vision, no matter who tells you not to.</strong>" - Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks</blockquote>
