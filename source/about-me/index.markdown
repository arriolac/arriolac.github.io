Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm a Software Engineer who specializes in developing mobile apps for Android and iOS. I've written and contributed to apps ranging from real-time messaging, to a cryptocurrency wallet used by millions of users. I also love to teach and have published a [book on RxJava](../book) and taught [courses on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-arkit--nd114) .

When I'm not coding, you can find me sipping coffee, climbing, or cycling somewhere.
